# Coffee Shop Chain Data Analysis ☕📊

Welcome to my analysis of a fictitious coffee shop chain based in New York, USA! This project leverages data provided by Maven Analytics (mavenanalytics.io). The dataset, originally in CSV format, was imported into Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## 🧩 Data Preparation and Cleaning

The data was imported into **Power BI**, where I used **Power Query** to clean, filter, format, and create relationships between tables before loading the final dataset. Below is the relationship diagram used to model the data:

## 🧐 Key Insights

### 📦 **Product Insights**
- **Beverage Sales Dominate:** Unsurprisingly, beverage sales make up nearly **80%** of all sales.
- **Pastries Underperform:** While the company bakes and sells pastries, there is a concern that demand is not matching supply. To boost pastry sales, the following strategies should be considered:
   - **Advertising 📣**
   - **Giveaways 🎁** during off-peak times

### 👥 **Customer Insights**
- **Age Group Analysis:**
  - The majority of customers (aged between **41-55**) contribute almost **50%** of all sales.
  - The next significant group is the **25-40** age range, contributing **16%** of sales.
- **Marketing Opportunity:** In the next marketing meeting, I suggest exploring strategies to attract more customers from a broader age range. This could involve:
   - Researching customer affiliations with the brand 🤔
   - Reviewing competitors' products and incentives to enhance customer experience 🏆

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI** for data analysis and visualization
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** for building formulas and data modeling

## 📝 Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into customer behavior and product performance for the coffee shop chain. Moving forward, it’s crucial to explore ways to optimize sales for underperforming products and attract a wider customer base.
